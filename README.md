What does Speachy mean? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo2wWB7cYk4

_Speachy_ helps you connect your application entities and their pages to your users voice. It simplifies the recognition workflows, as it focuses you to structure the recognition on basic sentence constructs - verbs, nouns and adjectives. Using sentence constructs, you can easily lead the user to the wanted page, product or even product list without typing and clicking -- in Minority Report style.
