What does Speachy mean? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo2wWB7cYk4

_Speachy_ helps you connect your application entities and their pages to your users voice. It simplifies the recognition workflows, as it focuses you on basic sentence constructs - **verbs**, **nouns** and **attributes**. Using sentence constructs, you can easily lead the user to the wanted page, product or even product list without typing and clicking -- in Minority Report style.
